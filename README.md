Absolutely! Let‚Äôs break down the **Basic Calculator Program** step by step so you understand **how it works** and **why each part is written** the way it is:

### ‚úÖ Full Code Recap

```python
# Basic Calculator Program

# Get user input
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
operation = input("Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): ")

# Perform calculation based on operation
if operation == "+":
    result = num1 + num2
    print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {result}")
elif operation == "-":
    result = num1 - num2
    print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {result}")
elif operation == "*":
    result = num1 * num2
    print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {result}")
elif operation == "/":
    if num2 != 0:
        result = num1 / num2
        print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {result}")
    else:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
else:
    print("Invalid operation. Please enter +, -, *, or /.")
```

### üîç **Explanation (Line by Line)**

#### 1. `# Basic Calculator Program`

* This is a **comment** ‚Äî it doesn't run as code.
* It's just a label to describe what the program is about.

---

#### 2. `num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))`

* `input()` takes input from the user (as a string).
* `float()` converts that input into a decimal number (e.g., `5.0`).
* The result is stored in a **variable** called `num1`.

---

#### 3. `num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))`

* Same as above, but for the second number.
* We store it in a variable named `num2`.

---

#### 4. `operation = input("Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): ")`

* This line asks the user to input a math **symbol**: `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`.
* It‚Äôs stored as a string in the `operation` variable.

---

#### 5. `if operation == "+":`

* This checks: **Did the user enter a `+`?**
* If **yes**, it calculates `num1 + num2`, stores the result, and prints it.

---

#### 6. `elif operation == "-":`

* If the user did **not** enter `+`, this checks for `-`.
* If true, it subtracts the two numbers.

---

#### 7. `elif operation == "*":`

* Checks if the user wants multiplication.
* If yes, it multiplies `num1 * num2`.

---

#### 8. `elif operation == "/":`

* Checks if the user wants division.
* If yes, there's one **extra check** inside:

```python
if num2 != 0:
```

* This makes sure we **don‚Äôt divide by zero**, which would crash the program.
* If `num2` is not zero, division happens. If it **is** zero, an error message is shown instead.

---

#### 9. `else:`

* If the user didn‚Äôt type `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`, this shows a warning:

```python
"Invalid operation. Please enter +, -, *, or /."
```

* It prevents the program from crashing or behaving unexpectedly.

| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Variables**      | Store numbers or text (`num1`, `operation`, `result`) |
| **Input & Output** | Using `input()` and `print()`                         |
| **Data types**     | Convert string input to `float` for calculations      |
| **If/Else logic**  | Make decisions based on user input                    |
| **Error handling** | Prevent division by zero with an `if` condition       |

Let me know if you'd like to:

* Add more operations (e.g. exponent `^`, modulus `%`)
* Turn this into a **loop** so the calculator runs repeatedly
* Upload it to GitHub together step-by-step
